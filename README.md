# MKJS Feedback

A repo for collating any and all feedback on our events

## How
Its simple. [Open an issue](https://github.com/mkjs/feedback/issues/new) to let us know your opinions.  

We'd be delighted to hear from you, if you've been to our session or not, about anything you'd like to see discussed, about anything that went well, anything that could be imporved upon, anything really -the more feedback we get, the better we can improve the meetups.


Thanks,
MKJS
